# Roles granting

#### Roles granting

We use Discord events to handle emotes that has been bound to messages,
which gains members some specific roles.
That means if the member add a reaction to a special message,
the bot grants them some specific role (e.g. `bi-pa1`) which permits the member to see such a channel.

Similarly, this is how authentication works,
only with added auth step.
