# Poll

#### `::poll`

This command creates different types of polls.
That can be useful to easily create a message that stands out
and that has automatically added all the poll options' reactions to it.

A poll can be of two types:

- `::poll abc` (multi choice poll)
- `::poll yesno` (simple yes or not poll)

The bot can also guess the type without you specifying it.
